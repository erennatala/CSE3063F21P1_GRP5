## About

This is the repository for the CSE 3063 Object-Oriented Software Design Term Project, Fall 2021 Group 5.

The purpose of this project is to simulate the student course registration process according to department regulations. The system checks whether a student can take available courses in the current semester, and handles situations that prevent course registration. At the end of the semester, the system generates grades, creates a GPA, and provides transcript files for each student. The simulation can be used to test if the system works properly and to observe how a distance education period would be handled.

This repository contains both a Java and Python project. The Java project was last updated on January 5, 2022, with an architecture fix. The Python project contains the project's artifacts and was last updated on January 16, 2022.

## Prerequisites

To run this system, you need:

- Devices that can execute the JAVA Runtime environment.
- JSON format is required for student transcripts.

Please note that the program will work offline, and it will not be able to synchronize or run on different systems. Therefore, only one user will be able to use it at a time.

## Functional Requirements

The system has several functional requirements:

- System requires an input file to start the simulation.
- System creates instructors.
- System creates courses.
- System assigns courses to instructors.
- System creates 70 students per semester.
- System provides available courses of the current semester.
- Students register courses according to regulations.
- System creates transcript files for each student.

## Nonfunctional Requirements

The system has several nonfunctional requirements:

- System creates a JSON file for each student.
- System does not use databases.
- System should be acceptable for the response time.
- System must have an infrastructure that will not crash due to overload during the simulation from start to finish.
